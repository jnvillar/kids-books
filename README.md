# Kids Books

This is a curated list of children's picture books that I like to read to my kids.
These books make great bedtime stories for children who haven't learned to read yet.
To be clear, these are *my* favorite books.
My kids like them alright, but their favorite books are probably not on this list.

Feel free to submit a pull request to recommend books.
There is no official schema to the list yet, but I would require at least:
* `title`
* `author`
* `isbn`
